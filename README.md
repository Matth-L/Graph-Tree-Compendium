# 📚 Graph-Tree-Compendium

This project is a compilation of three different data structures and algorithms:

- 🌳 **Maze Generation & Resolution**:
  - Maze generation using the Growing Tree algorithm.
  - Maze resolution using Depth-First Search (DFS) and A\* algorithms.

- 📊 **K-D Tree Implementation**:
  - Efficient organization of points in a k-dimensional space for operations like nearest neighbor search.

- 🖼️ **Image Compression Algorithm**:
  - Implementation of an algorithm to compress images efficiently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To execute these projects, navigate to the corresponding folder and run the following commands:

```sh
cd <folder>
make
./bin/<executable_name>
```

Replace `<folder>` with the name of the directory containing the project you want to run (e.g., `maze`, `kdtree`, `image_compression`). Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of the executable file generated after compilation.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Make utility
